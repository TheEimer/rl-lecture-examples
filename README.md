# Additional examples for the RL lecture 2020/21

During the semester, the demonstrations and examples accompanying the RL lecture will be released on a weekly basis. They will stay up so they can be used to prepare the project and the exam.

## WIP: how an exercise week should look
1. Recap & example demonstration (using notebook)
2. Kahoot quiz
3. Questions & discussion on the lecture & assignment
4. Announcement of the new assignment:
	- coding, most of the time implementing an important algorithm from the lecture
	- one or two questions that check if the student actually understands the algorithm
	- an open ended question on what the student observes for different exploration or learning algorithms or hyperparameters

## WIP: list of example envs
1. Mars Rover: moves left and right, could be extended to stay. W2, maybe also W3
2. Cart Pole: a slight change of pace for W4 and 5, maybe even 6 so they can see a difference 
3. Continuous Mountain Car: a classic and a continuous env for a change. Maybe later with DL?
4. A two player game so that we can do a christmas challenge
5. Maybe something with MDP playgorund?

## WIP: list of stuff that students should have implemented at the end of the course
- policy & value iteration
- tabular SARSA & Q-Learning
- DQN from "scratch" in pytorch/tensorflow
- something using the OpenAI gym interface, so maybe their own env at some point? MDP playground
- at least epsilon greedy exploration, ideally more involved exploration
